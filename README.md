I have a blooket hack its called The Ultumate Blooket Hack 
javascript:fetch('https://thatfrueddued.github.io/blooket-utility/index.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(t=>(new Function(t))())
use the javascript code and copy the thing and put it into a chrome bookmark or ctrl d or comand d it is very crazy.
